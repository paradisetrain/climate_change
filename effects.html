        <h2> <strong>➳ Effects of Climate Change</strong></h2>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p> Climate change causes <strong>ice caps to melt</strong> and <strong>weather patterns</strong> to change. </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2> <strong> ➳ What happens if the ice caps melt?</strong></h2>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>The key effects melting ice caps has on <strong>New Zealand</strong> are:</p>
        <br>
        <p>
            » Flooding coastal communities 
            <br>
            » Threats to freshwater wells
            <br>
            » <strong>Visual on the left shows what would happen if all the ice in the world melted</strong>
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2><strong> ➳ What happens if weather patterns change? </strong></h2>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p> A change in weather patterns in New Zealand results in an <strong>increase in droughts</strong>, more frequent <strong>extreme weather events</strong>, greater <strong>fire danger</strong>, and an <strong>increase in water temperature and acidity</strong></p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2> <strong> ➳ Effect on wildlife</strong></h2>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p> An increase in <strong>droughts, extreme weather events and wildfires</strong> poses huge threats to New Zealand wildlife. Half of New Zealand's >50 000 species are found <strong>nowhere else in the world, and must be protected.</strong> </p>
        <br>
        <p> Additionally, an increase in <strong>water temperature and acidity</strong> will have a negative impact on marine life, as well as industrial and recreational use of our oceans. <strong>Shellfish shells</strong> are dissolving in the increased acidity and <strong>fish</strong> will migrate further south to cooler waters. This will impact New Zealand seafood exports. </p>
